# project

This project aims to analyze factors which predict abortion attitudes in the United States.
In our analysis, we investigate whether an individual's political ideology and attitudes towards other issues, such as the importance of God in their life and their beliefs about child autonomy, predict their view on the justifiability of abortion.
